# About this project
Custom stylesheet for [filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) that adds colors and changes some icons.  
Ugly hack that works on my setup. Issues and PRs welcome.

## What it does
This css *colorizes* some file types' icons, so different files can be distinguished more easily.  
It also *changes some icons* to make distinguishing them even more easy.

* Go to Settings â†’ Global Settings and enter the path to where you saved the custom.css in "Branding Directory path"

You can also set this on  the [commandline](https://filebrowser.org/configuration/custom-branding).
